# Directory can be imported under its name if it contains a __init__.py
# file.  The __init__.py file is executed on the module import.  It can
# be empty or it can be used to import function from other files in the
# directory.  The Python files in the directory are not loaded unless
# called from __init__.py or imported explicitly with "import dir1.file".

# The first string in the __init__.py file is a docstring for the directory
