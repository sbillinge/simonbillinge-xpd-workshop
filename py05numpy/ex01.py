'''Task1, load the 3 column data from a .txt file using numpy.loadtxt

The ex1.txt is a 3 column data file. Loading the data from it using
numpy.loadtxt function and return a 2D array 'rv'. The shape of 2D array should
be [3, n], where n is the length of the data. So you can access the x column by
rv[x]. You may use transpose() function/method to transpose the 2d array, or
unpack keywords in numpy.loadtxt function.

Assume you finish your data process and want to save the results to a file. You
have 3 array to save, which is x, y, and dy. The data file saved in disk should
have 3 column format, i.e. x,y,dy in each line of the file and there are n lines
in total. To do so the actual array you saved should be in shape of [3,n]. You
may use numpy.transpose() function. to transpose the 2D array.

You can also save/load ndarray using binary format .npy, which is only
accessable by numpy The ex3.npy is a .npy file which contains a 100*100 array.
You can use numpy.load to load the array from this file. Then do some process
and save it in the save format using numpy.save .
