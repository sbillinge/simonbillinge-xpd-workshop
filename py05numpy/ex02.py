'''this exercise is generally focusing on Broadcasting, element-wise operations,
slices, and ranges. You can write your script here then run it. It is better to
using a interactive shell, Ipython for example to do the task and see the
results immediately.

If you are using interactive shell like Ipython, you should first run this
script using %run command (In [x]: %run ex02.py). Then the example array
s1,s2,s3 will be available in your shell.

               [1,4,9,16,25],
               [1,8,27,64,125]])
